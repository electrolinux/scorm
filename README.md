Adds SCORM module support to the [Elefant CMS](http://www.elefantcms.com/).

## Status: Beta

Needs additional conformance testing, but the core functionality works.

Install modules by uploading zip files through the Tools > SCORM area.
Embed SCORM modules into any page through the Dynamic Objects button in
the page editor. SCORM data is saved to the database and available via
the `scorm\Data` model.

Compatible with SCORM 1.2 and 2004 API versions.
