Adds SCORM module support to the [Elefant CMS](http://www.elefantcms.com/).

## Status: Alpha

Currently you can install modules by uploading zip files, view and delete them, 
and embed them into any page. The rendering is still in development, and the
API doesn't communicate with the server to record SCO events yet.
